The [Pew Research Centerâ€™s](http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/04/15/global-morality/) 2013 Global Attitudes survey asked 40,117 respondents in 40 countries what they thought about eight topics often discussed as moral issues: extramarital affairs, gambling, homosexuality, abortion, premarital sex, alcohol consumption, divorce, and the use of contraceptives.

For each issue, respondents were asked whether it is morally acceptable, morally unacceptable, or not a moral issue. 

I have tabulated, charted and mapped the results
